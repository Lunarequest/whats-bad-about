Reasons not to use popular products and services, just like on RMS's website

## Reasons not to use Adobe
* Adobe uses the "software as a service" pattern which gives it complete control over who is allowed to use their software, and it can be revoked at any time, such as when a [government requires it](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20904030/adobe-venezuela-photoshop-behance-us-sanctions). With this licensing model, you never own what you're paying for, you're just renting it.

## Reasons not to use Microsoft
* Microsoft uses confusing UI patterns to [coerce Windows users to create online accounts during installation](https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-users-fume-microsoft-wheres-our-local-account-option-gone/)

## Reasons not to use Samsung
* Samsung was caught [rigging smartphone benchmarks, and reporting higher performance.](https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/02/samsung-galaxy-s4-class-action-lawsuit/) The court ordered them to pay $10 per person, which is insultingly low.
