Reasons not to use popular products and services, just like on RMS's website

## Reasons not to use Microsoft
* Microsoft uses confusing UI patterns to [coerce Windows users to create online accounts during installation](https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-users-fume-microsoft-wheres-our-local-account-option-gone/)

## Reasons not to use Samsung
* Samsung was caught [rigging smartphone benchmarks, and reporting higher performance.](https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/02/samsung-galaxy-s4-class-action-lawsuit/) The court ordered them to pay $10 per person, which is insultingly low.
