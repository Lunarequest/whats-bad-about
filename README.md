Reasons not to use popular products and services, just like on RMS's website

## Reasons not to use Adobe
* Adobe uses the "software as a service" pattern which gives it complete control over who is allowed to use their software, and it can be revoked at any time, such as when a [government requires it](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20904030/adobe-venezuela-photoshop-behance-us-sanctions). With this licensing model, you never own what you're paying for, you're just renting it.

## Reasons not to use Blizzard
* Blizzard [banned a player from a major tournament](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/23179289/) for offending the sensibilities of the Communist Party of China by [supporting the Hong Kong protests publicly](https://www.pcgamer.com/blitzchung-removed-from-hearthstone-grandmasters-for-liberate-hong-kong-comments/). Blizzard is partially owned by Tencent, which in turn is owned by the Chinese government. History shows that it is exceedingly easy to offend the Chinese government with Winnie the Pooh memes and other nonsense - we should not let oppressive governments dictate what we are allowed to express, especially abroad.

## Reasons not to use Microsoft
* Microsoft uses confusing UI patterns to [coerce Windows users to create online accounts during installation](https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-users-fume-microsoft-wheres-our-local-account-option-gone/)

## Reasons not to use Samsung
* Samsung was caught [rigging smartphone benchmarks, and reporting higher performance.](https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/02/samsung-galaxy-s4-class-action-lawsuit/) The court ordered them to pay $10 per person, which is insultingly low.
